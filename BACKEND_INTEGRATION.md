```java
// Token Structure
{
  "sub": "user@example.com",
  "iat": 1641234567,
  "exp": 1641320967,
  "roles": ["ROLE_USER", "ROLE_PREMIUM"]
}
```

### Security Features
- **BCrypt Password Hashing**: Industry-standard encryption
- **Token Expiration**: 24-hour token lifecycle
- **CORS Configuration**: Frontend-specific access control
- **Request Validation**: Input sanitization and validation
- **Role-based Access**: Premium feature restrictions
- **Rate Limiting**: API abuse prevention

### Protected Endpoints
All API endpoints (except auth) require valid JWT tokens:
```java
@PreAuthorize("hasRole('USER')")
public ResponseEntity<?> getProtectedData()
```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Backend Setup
```bash
# Prerequisites
java --version  # Requires Java 17+
mvn --version   # Requires Maven 3.6+

# Start Backend
cd backend
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh

# Alternative
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### 2. API Testing
```bash
# Test public endpoints
curl http://localhost:8080/api/

# Authentication
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/signin \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "tom@example.com", "password": "password123"}'

# Protected endpoint (replace TOKEN)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:8080/api/dashboard/stats
```

### 3. Database Integration Ready
The backend is designed for easy database integration:

```java
// Current: In-memory mock data
@Service
public class MockDataService {
    // Mock implementations
}

// Future: Database integration
@Service
public class DatabaseService {
    @Autowired
    private UserRepository userRepository;
    // Real database operations
}
```
